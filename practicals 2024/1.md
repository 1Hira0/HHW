# Basic Components of a Computer

A computer is an electronic device that processes data to produce meaningful information. It consists of several essential components, each playing a crucial role in its operation. The main components of a computer are:

## 1. Input Unit
The input unit allows users to enter data and instructions into the computer. Some common input devices include:

- **Keyboard** – Used for typing text and commands.
- **Mouse** – A pointing device for selecting and navigating.
- **Scanner** – Converts physical documents into digital format.
- **Microphone** – Captures audio input.

## 2. Central Processing Unit (CPU)
The CPU is the **brain of the computer**, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. It consists of three main parts:

- **Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)** – Performs mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, etc.) and logical operations (comparisons like greater than, less than, etc.).
- **Control Unit (CU)** – Directs the flow of data within the computer and coordinates the operations of various components.
- **Registers** – Small memory units inside the CPU that store temporary data and instructions.

## 3. Memory Unit
The memory unit stores data, instructions, and results. It is divided into two main types:

- **Primary Memory (RAM & ROM)**
  - **RAM (Random Access Memory)** – Temporary memory used by the CPU to store data currently in use. It is volatile (loses data when power is off).
  - **ROM (Read-Only Memory)** – Permanent memory that contains essential system instructions like boot-up processes. It is non-volatile.
- **Secondary Memory (Storage Devices)**
  - **Hard Disk Drive (HDD) / Solid-State Drive (SSD)** – Used for long-term data storage.
  - **Pen Drive, Memory Card, CD/DVD** – Portable storage devices.

## 4. Output Unit
The output unit presents the processed data (information) to the user. Common output devices include:

- **Monitor (Screen)** – Displays text, images, and videos.
- **Printer** – Produces hard copies of digital documents.
- **Speakers** – Output sound.

## 5. Power Supply Unit (PSU)
The power supply unit converts electrical power from an external source into a usable form for the computer’s internal components.

## 6. Motherboard
The motherboard is the **main circuit board** that connects and allows communication between the CPU, memory, storage, and other components.

## 7. Communication Devices (Networking Components)
These components allow the computer to connect to the internet and other networks:

- **Network Interface Card (NIC)** – Enables wired or wireless internet connectivity.
- **Modem & Router** – Help in internet communication.

## Conclusion
All these components work together to make a computer function effectively. Understanding these parts helps in knowing how computers operate and how they can be used efficiently.
